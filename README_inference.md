Use this blueprint to immediately detect object elements and their position in images. To use this pretrained object detection model, create a ready-to-use API endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprintâ€™s model was trained using [Common Objects in Context (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home) data. To use custom object data according to your specific business, run this counterpart's [training blueprint](../object-detection-blueprint/README.md), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy this object-detector API endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button. The cnvrg Blueprint Flow page displays.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   * Use the Try it Live section with any object image to check the model.
   * Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in your code snippet.

An API endpoint that detects objects in images has now been deployed.
