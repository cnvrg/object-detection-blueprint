You can use this blueprint to immediately detect object elements and their position in your images.
For using this pretrained logo detection model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.
1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can use the `Try it Live` section with any image to check your model
5. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that detects object elements in images!
